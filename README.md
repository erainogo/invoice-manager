# Invoice Manager

A Laravel-based system to manage and process CSV file uploads for payment records, run background jobs using Redis & Horizon, and generate daily payout summaries.

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Laravel (already included in project)
- CSV files containing payment data

---

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/invoice-manager.git
cd invoice-manager
```

### 2. Start Docker Containers

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```

This spins up the following containers:

- **php** (Laravel backend)
- **webserver** (Nginx)
- **mysql** (MySQL database)
- **redis** (for queueing and caching)
- **horizon** (Laravel Horizon for job management)

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
docker exec -it invoice-manager-app composer install
```

### 4. Set File Permissions

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 storage bootstrap/cache
```

### 5. Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then configure DB, Redis, etc.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker exec -it invoice-manager-app php artisan key:generate
```

### 6. Run Migrations

```bash
docker exec -it invoice-manager-app php artisan migrate
```

## 📬 API Usage

### Login 

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "<your_email>", "password": "<your_password>"}'
```

### Upload a CSV File

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-token>" \
  -F "file=@customer_transactions.csv"
```

Replace `<your-api-token>` with your actual token.

## ⚙️ Background Jobs

The application uses Redis and Laravel Horizon to handle background processing of uploaded files.

### Start Horizon (already started via Docker)

```bash
# Automatically runs in the 'horizon' service container:
php artisan horizon
```

You can monitor Horizon at:

```
http://localhost:8000/horizon
```

### Jobs:

- **ProcessPaymentFileJob**: Parses and processes uploaded CSV files.
-   queue - payment-file-upload-queue

- **ProcessPaymentRowJob**: Handles individual rows.
-   queue - payment-file-read-queue

- **UploadFileToS3MultipartJob**: (if used) handles large file uploads.
-   queue - payment-payout-processing-queue

---

## ⏰ Scheduled Task

The app includes a scheduled command to run daily:

```php
$schedule->command('app:daily-payout-command')->dailyAt("01:00");
```

---

## 📂 File Storage

Uploaded files are stored in S3 via multipart uploads.

You can configure your S3 credentials in `.env`.

---

## 📈 Monitoring

- Laravel Horizon is used for monitoring job queues.
- Access it at: http://localhost:8000/horizon


## 🔧 Docker Configuration

The application uses custom Docker configurations for optimal performance:

# Dockerfile Features

dockerfile# FROM php:8.3-fpm

# Large file upload settings in image
- upload_max_filesize=200M
- post_max_size=200M
- memory_limit=512M
- max_execution_time=300

## PHP-FPM Pool Configuration

- pm = dynamic
- pm.max_children = 50
- pm.start_servers = 10
- pm.min_spare_servers = 5
- pm.max_spare_servers = 10

These settings ensure optimal handling of concurrent large file uploads and processing.

## 📧 Email Configuration
The application uses Mailtrap for email testing and notifications.

## Setup Mailtrap

- Sign up for a Mailtrap account
- Create a new inbox in your Mailtrap dashboard
- Copy the SMTP credentials to your .env file
